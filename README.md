# ENCS3320 Computer Networks Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a TCP client-server interaction and a simple web server, as per the ENCS3320 - Computer Networks course requirements. The projects use socket programming to demonstrate key networking concepts through HTTP and DNS protocols.

## Features
- **Part 2: TCP Client-Server Application** - Comprises `client.py` and `server.py`, which manage TCP connections, validate student IDs, and control OS screen lock commands.
- **Part 3: Web Server** - Utilizes `web-server.py`, along with HTML and CSS files, to process HTTP requests and serve content.

## Languages and Tools
- Python for backend development
- HTML/CSS for frontend design
- Wireshark for network packet analysis (this part is detailed in the report)

## Project Structure
- `client.py` - Client-side script for TCP communication.
- `server.py` - Server-side script for managing TCP connections.
- `web-server.py` - The core web server script for handling HTTP requests.
- `main_en.html`/`main_ar.html` - Web pages in English and Arabic.
- `main.css`/`second.css` - CSS files for styling the web pages.
- `secondary.html` - An additional web page served by the web server, demonstrating the ability to serve multiple resources.

## Documentation
- `Project Description` - Contains detailed instructions for the project.
- `projectReport.pdf` - A detailed report of the project, explaining the design, development, and testing processes.
